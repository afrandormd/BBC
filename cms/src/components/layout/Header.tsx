// Let's assume it's renamed and updated.

// See AppHeader.tsx for the new content.
// This file can be deleted or updated if any distinct global header logic remains.
// For this change, we will assume it's refactored into AppHeader.tsx.
// If you need to keep this as a separate global non-dashboard header, let me know.

// For now, this file can be considered empty or deleted as its role is taken by AppHeader.tsx in the dashboard.
// If it was used outside the dashboard, it would need different handling.
// Based on the prompt, the focus is the dashboard experience.

// To avoid breaking existing imports if Header was used elsewhere (unlikely given context),
// we'll provide a minimal export.
// Better: rename calls to AppHeader.
// Let's assume this component (src/components/layout/Header.tsx) is no longer directly used
// and its relevant functionalities for the dashboard header are now in AppHeader.tsx

export function Header() {
  // This component's functionality is largely moved to AppHeader.tsx
  // and Sidebar.tsx for dashboard context.
